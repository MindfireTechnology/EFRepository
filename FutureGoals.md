## Future Goals
 - Better handling of client-provided ID's
	- What is the expected behavior for AddOrUpdate on a new Client side generated ID?
	- Add an attribute?
 - Better support for Transactions
	- Test to see if we're inside of a transaction?
	- If the transaction is already in progress, then throw on BeginTrans
	- Commit or Rollback or throw on dispose?
 - Concurrency
 - AddOrUpdate with a New object that uses an existing object as a relation
	- If you're not using lazy loading, a simple recursive add
	- If you are using lazy loading, then it's your responsibility?
- Soft Deletes
